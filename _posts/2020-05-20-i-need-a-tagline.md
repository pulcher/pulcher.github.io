# I need a tagline for my YouTube and twitch channels

## Why all of a sudden

Saw video.  If I really want this to happen there are few things I need to do.

## Three Powerful Questions
Wanting to do more with my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/hpulcher) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/haroldpulcher) channels, I knew I needed help.  I do not know how the YouTube algorithm knew this, but it recommended 
[How to Start a Successful YouTube Channel in 2020 â€” 3 Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnkVZm2ijfY).  I admit this did inspire me.  I watched the entire video and killed a bunch of PostIt notes.  

There was so much to figure out that I hadn't really thought of before.  I have a lot of __hard__ questions to answer, so I am only going to tackle one them at a time.  The first of these is about my __Channel__.  

The video points out that I really need to answer the following 

## 1. Channel
That was a bit terse, but the idea is how do you define your channel.  Sean go on for a bit with stories and the such, but it boils down to being able to define the following attributes for your channel.

### Who is the channel for?
This channel would be for anyone who has ever said "Someone should make something that does __name your idea here__".  I know a lot of very creative and imaginative people that have wonderful ideas, but
never even try to make that idea happen because that know how.  I am a __Jack or all trades__.  The second part of the line is __master of none__.  You don't have to be a master to start making.  
Even masters had to start somewhere.  How they received their spark, I have know idea.  

I would like to help in getting that spark going in people.  Mostly by coming up with and idea for a project and building it.  Documenting all that I can.  I showing the learning process of how 
I figured out something I that didn't know before I started the project.  For instance my current robot project will require: Electronics, Programming, 3D modeling/printing, mechanical design, networking, 
motors, and a few things I don't know that I am going to need.  

I enjoy the process almost as much as seeing the result.

### What problem does it solve.
I believe fear of the unknown is what stops most from even trying something new.  After they see what I go through, I hope some will make an attempt.  Especially after the see my mess up.
I hope that realize that they can do no worse and it is not so painful to try.

### How am I different
I believe in showing the good with the bad.  I think mistakes can be more of a learning experience than being successful on the first try.  Many time I will be successful, but not always.  I lean to 
those mistakes and I will not hide them.

### Why should I subscribe
They will get some knowledge that they may not have had before watching on my videos.  Hopefully, get a laugh or two.  Tune in to see a down to earth person figuring out problems.

Not all of my videos end this way, but I usually end with the following:  Whether it is from my failures or your successes, I hope you learned something today.

## How can you help
One of the points of the video was have a very narrow focus and be able to express this in an attention grabbing Tagline.  

I need your help to pick a Tagline that seems to fit.  I made a list of possible taglines. I can't decide if one of these is __the__ tagline or not.  I would really like if you could leave me your opinions in the comments section.
