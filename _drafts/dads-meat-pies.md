# Dad's Louisiana Meat Pies

I remember the first time that Dad(or any of my family) had a __Natchitoches Meat Pie__.  It was 
during the [Nachitoches Christmas Festival of Lights](http://www.christmasfestival.com/). Not sure of the year, but it was the weekend of all the parades during the day.  While wondering around 
waiting on the fireworks show and lighting of all the crazy amounts of lights, he saw this "Meat Pie" 
thing and just had to try one.  I don't remember how many he had, but he just knew he had to be 
able to recreate these things back home.

Not sure where he got is beginning recipe.  I remember him making and sharing tons of these things.  It seems 
that he would make these things at the drop of hat.  What I don't do here is make them as spicy hot as Dad did.  He 
used a ton of crushed red.  Some of those batches were meant for his co-workers who liked it extra hot!  Most 
others would have a hard time eating even a single pie.

# Base recipe for the meat filling

* 2 Tbsp Butter
* 1/2 lb Ground Beef
* 1/2 lb Ground Pork
* 1/2 lb Onion, finely chopped
* 1/2 lb Red Bell Pepper, finely chopped
* 1/4 Cup Celery, finely chopped
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 2 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
* 2 Tbsp Louisiana Hot Sauce
* Salt, Black Pepper, and Cayenne to taste
* 1/2 Cup Beef Stock
* 1/8 Cup All-Purpose Flour

Mix the beef and pork together.  I usually get boneless pork chops and stew cut meat.  Cut the pork chops into 
about the same size as the beef.  Feed this mixture into the grinder.  I usually do a second grind so that the 
pork and beef are throughly mixed.

In a large skillet over medium high heat, brown the meat and set aside.  
Melt the butter and saut√© the onion, Bell pepper, and celery until the they are all wilted.  Add the Garlic, Worcestershire, 
and hot sauce.    

Make a slurry with the beef stock and the flour, pour into the mixture.   

BTB-RTS(Bring to boil, reduce to simmer)

While simmering is where I make the final adjustments.  First taste the mixture and add salt, pepper, cayenne, and any of the other 
spices to taste.  The end mixture should be fairly thick.  If it is still loose, then make up some more slurry and add as needed.

Set all of this aside to cool.  No hot filling when making meat pies.  I usually make this then night before and refrigerate.  This 
gives the flavors time to mix and the mixture will thicken a bit more.

# Base recipe for the dough

* 8 Cups All-Purpose Flour
* 2 Tsp Kosher Salt
* 1 Tsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 Cup Lard 
* 2 Eggs
* 2 Cups of Milk

Combine the dry ingredients in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachement.  Roughly cube up the 
lard.  Start the mixer on low and add the lard to the dry.  Let the paddle cut in the lard until 
the lard bits are around pea size.  

Whisk the eggs into the milk.

Change out the paddle for a dough hook.  With the speed on low, slowly add the milk/egg mixture  
into the dry.  The dough should be not be wet and be easily worked.

Time to roll out the dough.  I used to used a rolling pin and elbow grease.  I have found that the 
pasta roller on my KitchenAid stand mixer todo a way better job.  Attach the sheeter and open it 
to its widest setting and the speed on low.  Grab a just over golf ball size bit of dough.  Flatten it out, so that 
it will run through the sheeter.  You may need to run it through a time or two, double it over until you get a clean 
smooth result.  Move the sheeter to the next lowest setting, and repeat.  I usually do a final run 
through on setting number 3. 

Layout the sheet on a cutting board.  Using largest bowl that will fill the width, place the bowl 
flat on the dough and cut around it to make the skin.

Stack these on a tray after sprinkling a little flour to keep them from sticking.  Separate the 
layers with parchment paper.
