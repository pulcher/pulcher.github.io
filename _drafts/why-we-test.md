# So why do we test?

## Classical Arguments

There are number of resources on the web talking about testing and the benefits.  In doing research 
for this series, I found a quote from Uncle Bob Martin 

> “The act of writing a unit test is more an act of design than of verification.  It is also more an act of documentation than of verification.  The act of writing a unit test closes a remarkable number of feedback loops, the least of which is the one pertaining to verification of function”

In breaking that statement down into addressable points, we have the following:

* Design
* Documentation
* Verification


* Code Documentation
* Favors early detection of bugs
* Forces better written code
* better design
* simpler design
* lower complexity
* increased productivity
* more maintainable code

## Why do we really test?

* Because sometimes it is hard 
* Prevents works on my machine
* Because you sleep
* Because you need to know how crappy your code is.
* All Software is tested it is just a matter of where. - Richard Campbell - look for this quote

# So when should you write a test?

* all the time - Adrian Cocroft quote
* Complicated features
* For every bug
* To prove to yourself how things really work.
* 10,000 time increase to fix in production - lookup source for quote
